# Firebase Realtime Database Listener Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem with a Firebase Realtime Database listener that fails to update after initial data load.  The `on('value')` method only triggers once, despite changes being made to the data in the database.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code.  The solution, addressing the issue, is in `bugSolution.js`.

This issue might be caused by a few factors, including:

* **Incorrect data structure:** Ensure your data structure is suitable for the updates you make.
* **Client-side caching:** Verify that the data isn't being cached on the client-side, preventing updates from being seen.
* **Connection issues:** Check your internet connection. Intermittent connections could cause delays or missed updates. 
* **Security rules:** Verify that your Firebase security rules permit the read and write operations.  The rules shouldn't block the updates.
* **Data types:** Mismatched data types between write and expected data could also cause this issue.
